~~\*\*~~ [Token Issuer Cheat Sheet](https://goo.gl/mgWx7v) ~~\*\*~~

If planning a sale of ‘prefunctional’ tokens - - i.e., you are fundraising to develop a functional network for ‘consumer’ or ‘utility’ token use - - or engaging in a ‘security token offering’ - - i.e., distributing tokens that represent equity - - readers should review potential SEC Registration Exemptions \(and/or international equivalent\), as outlined in the link above, “Token Issuer Cheat Sheet,” in order to gauge traditional compliance obligations under these common routes for early-stage funding, and more importantlly, _avoid liability for selling unregistered securities_. 

Nonetheless, this companion document, [_Token Sale Governance: Principles, Practices and Approaches_](https://goo.gl/jJak81)_,_ reflects relevant industry best practices that should be adopted \(_if not otherwise required_\), given current informational asymmetries and heightened security risks in digital asset transactions.
