# SEC Registration Exemptions - Token Issuer Cheat Sheet

~~\*\*~~ [Token Issuer Cheat Sheet](https://goo.gl/mgWx7v) ~~\*\*~~

If you are planning a sale of _**prefunctional tokens**_ - - i.e., you are fundraising to develop a network for future token use - - it is recommended to review SEC Registration Exemptions. This doubly applies if your tokens arguably represent equity, so-called _**security tokens**_.

Gauging traditional compliance obligations under these common exemptions for early-stage funding \(and avoiding liability for selling unregistered securities\) should remain top-of-mind.

Nonetheless, this companion document, [_Token Sale Governance: Principles, Practices and Approaches_](https://goo.gl/jJak81)_,_ reflects relevant industry best practices for sales of _**consumer tokens**_ that should also be adopted for _prefunctional/security token sales_ \(if not otherwise required\), given informational asymmetries and heightened security risks of digital asset transactions.
