# Welcome

Hey! 

I’m Ross Campbell. I’m a corporate attorney living in Brooklyn, helping launch Dapps and ICO standards. Here's my more respectable [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-campbell-058153aa/), where I don't have a mustache and look 12. 

Take a glance around here for curated crypto-law stuff. I've been hitting this pretty full tilt lately, so hope it helps. 

Not legal advice!
