# OpenLaw - Demos

I am currently working on two demos of Smart Legal Agreements on OpenLaw:

**\(i\) Asset Purchase Agreement,** w/ **escrow governed by smart contract;** 

See**:** [Github ****progress](https://github.com/Ro5s/MasterEscrow) on Source Code for escrow contract\(s\).

See also: [Simple Asset Purchase Agreement \(Ether Escrow\)](https://app.openlaw.io/template/Simple%20Asset%20Purchase%20Agreement%20%28Ether%20Escrow%29)

**\(+\)**  

**\(ii\)** **Assignment of Claim**, w/ **claim represented by token.**

See**:** [Demo token on Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x58c001573a515b5c22d5b4b4ca9eaedd186b0560)
