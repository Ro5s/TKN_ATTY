# BKP Transparency Scorecard - Templates

As part of ongoing effort to implement The Brooklyn Project's [Consumer Token Framework](https://framework.thebkp.com/project/BKP/document/1/version/1), the _Transparency Scorecard_ was developed to signal how well a "consumer" token project tracks the Framework's Transparency Goals, and more generally, industry recommendations for token offerings.

The following Google Docs draft is more adaptable, with my own notes on the transparency of the Civil token sale:
