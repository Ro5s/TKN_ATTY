# BKP Transparency Scorecard - Templates

As part of ongoing effort to implement The Brooklyn Project's [Consumer Token Framework](https://framework.thebkp.com/project/BKP/document/1/version/1), the "Transparency Scorecard" concept was developed to help signal how well a "consumer" token project follows the Framework's Transparency Goals, and more generally, how they track industry 'best practices' for token offerings. 

The Brooklyn Project [page ](https://framework.thebkp.com/project/CVL/document/2/version/3)dedicated to developing the Transparency Scorecard is difficult to scrape for independent forms. The following Google Docs draft is more adaptable, with my own notes on the transparency of the Civil token sale:
